# Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## Project Background and Context

SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers, who charge upwards of $165 million. This cost advantage is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Predicting the success of the first stage landing is crucial for determining the cost-effectiveness of a launch. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning pipeline that predicts whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. This information is valuable for other companies that may want to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## Objectives

- **Identify Key Factors**: Determine the factors that influence the successful landing of the rocket's first stage.
- **Feature Interaction**: Analyze the interaction among various features to understand their impact on the success rate of landings.
- **Operational Conditions**: Identify the necessary operating conditions for a successful landing program.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection

- **API Data Collection**: Gathered data through API access to various databases.
- **Web Scraping**: Supplemented data using web scraping techniques to collect additional relevant information.

### 2. Data Wrangling

- Cleaned and processed the collected data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **SQL Analysis**: Used SQL for initial exploratory data analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized data trends and patterns using various visualization techniques.

### 4. Interactive Visual Analytics

- **Folium**: Created interactive maps to visualize launch sites and landing outcomes.

### 5. Machine Learning Prediction

- Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of the first stage landing successfully.

## Summary of Results

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Identified key factors influencing landing success, such as booster version, payload mass, orbit type, and launch site conditions.

### Interactive Analytics

- **Screenshots**: Provided interactive visualizations showcasing launch site locations and landing outcomes.

### Predictive Analytics

- Successfully built a predictive model with satisfactory accuracy in forecasting the landing outcome of the first stage.
